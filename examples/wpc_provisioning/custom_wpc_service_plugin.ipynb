        "# Creating a custom WPC Service adapter\n",
        "This chapter is for those users, who wish not to use EL2GO, but rather have their own solution.\n",
        "\n",
        "To help you getting started with creating a custom Service, we have a [Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) template located in: `<spsdk_repo>/examples/templates/cookiecutter-spsdk-wpc-service-plugin.zip`  \n",
        "This template will create a Python project, containing a plugin for SPSDK\n",

        "    * follow the prompts\n",
        "    * your project will be created in the current working directory\n",

        "        * Use this method to provide JSON validation schema for your class (parameters for the `__init__` method)\n",
        "        * Schema will be used when instantiating your class using configuration data via `.load_from_config` method\n",
        "        * This schema will be also used to generate configuration file using `nxpwpc get-template`\n",
        "    * `get_wpc_cert`\n",
        "        * This method is the bread and butter of your adapter\n",
        "        * Here is where you'll implement the process of getting the WPC Certificate Chain\n",
        "1. Install your plugin into virtual environment where you have SPSDK\n",
        "    * `pip install (--editable) <path/to/your/project>`\n",
        "    * The `--editable` flag is used for development purposes. It will allow you to develop your plugin without a need to re-install your plugin after every change\n",
        "1. Verify your plugin was picked-up by SPSDK\n",
        "    * `nxpwpc get-template --help`\n",
        "    * You should see the name of your plugin in `--service-type` option\n",
        "    * Name of the plugin is set during project creation, also defined in your class as `identifier` attribute"
