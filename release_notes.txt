Release Notes for Secure Provisioning SDK
==========================================
Secure Provisioning SDK (SPSDK) is a unified, reliable, and easy-to-use SW library. It targets a wide
portfolio of NXP MCUs, providing a solid foundation from quick customer prototyping up to
production deployment. The library allows the user to connect and communicate with a device,
configure the device, prepare, download and upload data, including security operations. It is
delivered in the form of a python library and command-line applications.

Version: 1.3.1.

Features:
- [PFR] configuration template supports YAML with description, backward compatibility with JSON ensured
- [PFR] API change: "keys" parameter has been moved from __init__ to export
- [PRF] sub-commands renamed: (user-config -> get-cfg-template; parse -> parse-binary; generate -> generate-binary)
- [blhost] allow key names for key-provisioning commands
- [blhost] support for RT1170, RT1160
- Shadow Registers tool is now top-level module
