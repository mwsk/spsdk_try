Date: 05-March-2021

Secure Provisioning SDK (SPSDK) is unified, reliable and easy to use SW library working across NXP MCU portfolio 
providing strong foundation from quick customer prototyping up to production deployment. The library allows the user 
to connect and communicate with a device, configure the device, prepare, download and upload data including security 
operations. It is delivered in a form of python library and command line applications.

Features:
- support creation of SB version 3.1 (for N4Analog)
- elftosb application based on legacy elf2sb supporting SB 3.1 support 
- nxpdevscan - application for connected USB, UART devices discovery
- shadowregs -  application for shadow registers management using DebugProbe
- support USB path argument in blhost/sdphost (all supported OS)
- nxpcertgen cli application (basicConstrains, self-signed)
- extend blhost commands:
    - flash-erase-all
    - call
    - load-image
    - execute
    - key-provisioning
    - receive-sb-file
- extend blhost commands' options:
    - configure-memory now allows usage of internal memory
    - extend error code in output
    - add parameters lock/nolock into efuse-program-once command
    - add key selector option to generate-key-blob command
    - add nolock/lock selector to efuse-program-once command
    - add hexdata option to write-memory command
