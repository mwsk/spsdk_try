AHAB
------

AHAB (Advanced High Assurance Boot) is a container format supported on some devices. A configuration file in YAML or
JSON is used to instruct nxpimage how the output should look like.

Example of use for export
``nxpimage ahab export -c "path\to\config\file.yaml"``

Example of use for parse binary AHAB container
``nxpimage ahab parse -b "my_ahab_container.bin" -o "path\to_parsed_data"``

The full AHAB configuration template could be generated by nxpimage tool "get_template" sub-command for family that supports AHAB, example:
``nxpimage ahab get-template -f rt118x -o ahab_template_rt118x.yaml``

AHAB Extensions
================
Since SPSDK version 2.2.0, support for AHAB extensions have been added.
This allows the user to create the standard images like U-Boot for example in the similar manner as with the imx-mkimage tool, without knowing the details of the AHAB format.
